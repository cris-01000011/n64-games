		<desc>Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this platformer.

The player can either choose to be Reinhardt Schneider (for the traditional whip action) or Carrie Fernandez (who uses magical powers). Both characters have their own story line. A nice feature is the presence of an in-game clock which changes the time of the day (either day or night).

Reinhardt &amp;amp; Carrie both appear again in the second Castlevania game for the N64: Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, which has new layouts for the levels of this game.</desc>

During the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.</desc>

Of course, the pot's answer doesn't please the hag-- he singles out Banjo's sister, Tooty. When Tooty turns up missing, Banjo and his birdie buddy Kazooie set out to find her. 

The worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are gigantic, and chock full of crazy items to collect. Musical Notes, Puzzle Pieces ("Jiggies"), Mumbo Tokens, and Jinjoes are just some of the swag that Banjo must stuff in his backpack to complete his adventure. While some of the necessary items are simply stashed off the beaten path, others will require puzzle solving skills to turn up.</desc>

		<desc>After two years under the rock, Gruntilda is finally set free from her death bed by her two sisters. As nothing but a skeleton, Grunty and her sisters plan a way of curing her looks by sucking the life out of the land so as to restore her body to its old self. On hearing this news, our two champs Banjo and Kazooie with the aid of Mumbo set out to stop the evil plan and seek revenge for the passing away of Bottles the mole.

In this sequel to Banjo-Kazooie, you can play as the two main characters (as well as Mumbo) just like before, although they can now separate, helping them get to even harder areas of the land. You must collect jiggies to open new areas (much like the original) as well as learn 40 new moves to help you get along.

And much like another Rareware title, Donkey Kong 64, you can play four-player minigames that range from first-person shooters, bumper cars, battle for points, etc..</desc>

		<desc>Get out of the way!  A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.

Blast Corps is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits, trucks, or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes its not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it does!

Blast Corps features many secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once ts over to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDU's (Radiation Dispersal Units) which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them. Players must also destroy all of the buildings, and rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...</desc>

		<name>Buck Bumble (Japan)</name>
		<desc>A chemical spill somewhere in rural England has mutated an army of bees into killer, deadly insects. Led by their queen, they are out to destroy everything living thing on the planet, including all insects that dare stop them.

Only Buck Bumble, the only bee not to be turned evil by the ways of the queen, can save the world, and his fellow insects, from total destruction.

Using Buck's weapons, you must shoot down the many swarms of enemy bees, while staying above ground avoiding the hazards bellow. At times you may have to land on the ground and attack on foot, while certain enemies can only be destroyed by certain weapons.

Also included is a handful of two-player split-screen modes, including Buzz Ball, a unique soccer style game where each player controls a Bee while attempting to kick the slightly larger ball into the others goal.</desc>

		<name>Choro Q 64 (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Penny Racers is a racing game with cartoonish, made-of-paper-like cars. There are thirteen cars which you can choose from and nine tracks in total – all available right from the start. It features two playable modes, Race Series and Time Trial, and a mode that allows you to create your own track. The game also supports up to four human players. 

In Race Series you can select one of the thirteen cars and race in any of the nine tracks with five more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty) races at first but can unlock more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each race you are given the option to customize your car’s parts – parts like the car’s body, engine, tires, etc. – but only if you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the other cars at the end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players.

Time Trial is the basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost to race against.

VS Race mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that are different from the ones of the other modes and these tracks have more obstacles. 

New Track lets you create your own custom made track. You can select the road type (on road/off road) and track type (circuit/stage). After the basic layout is selected you are taken on the “map” where you can choose from the available layers to make the track. You can also adjust the road’s height.</desc>

		<desc>The Sequel to the famous snowboard simulation Snowboard Kids is a fun family sports game. It combines a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. 

Player can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite basic, sometimes similar to the Kirby series concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. 

Winning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.</desc>

		<name>Dezaemon 3D (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Dezaemon 3D is more of a game creator than an actual game. While it ships with two games, what really makes the cartridge special is the editor. It is far more than a level editor - you can use it to design your own 3D shooting game! In fact, both games were done with the very same editor. 

Designing 3D models, doing textures and composing a hit song are no small tasks mind you, so if you are more of the impatient type, you can skip the editor and head straight for the two sample games, Solid Gear and Usagi. Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. 

Solid Gear is a "serious" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. 

Usagi is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles.. and bunnies. A whole lot of bunnies.</desc>

		<desc>It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island!  After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return.  Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.

Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons.  However, the similarities end there.  DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge".  In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).

The game also features a strategic method of using weapons.  Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times).  This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.

Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game.  There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).</desc>

		<desc>Take a collection of fist-fighters, wrestlers and martial arts experts, and combine them into one tournament. But instead of relying on simply depleting the health bar, you must win points depending on how you defeat an opponent (for example, ring-outs are 1 point, special moves 4 points and countering a special move is 2 points). 

Game modes include the standard VS. mode, simply defeat everyone you see. VS. Battle allows you to defeat the enemy, then acquire their moves for the next round. The Master Challenge has you spinning a wheel to determine who your fight. Spin up a Master, and you get a tough challenge in which you can win new moves. Spin a Joker, and you simply have a challenge, with nothing to gain, but everything to lose.</desc>

		<desc>Goemon and his friends return in this side-scrolling sequel to Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon.  Bismaru, who looks like Goemon's friend Ebisumaru dressed up as a nun, has swiped a freshly-invented Ghost Returning Machine!  With it, he's using planning nothing less than world domination.  All Ebisumaru wanted to do with it was meet his ancestor, James Dean!  Help Goemon and his friends retrieve the Machine, and bust some ghosts on the way.

Mystical Ninja 2 reverts back to the traditional side-scrolling 2D platforming style of the SNES games.  However, due to to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities, you'll encounter massive bosses and detailed worlds as you make your way through Japan.  To attack, you can either hurl coins, or use each character's specific weapon, such as Goemon's trademark pipe.  Two players can also play simultaneously and work together to beat foes, and you can even ride piggy-back onto your friend.

There are also towns to explore, where you chat with villagers and explore various shops and houses for information and clues.  Goemon Impact, the giant singing robot wearing rollerskates, also makes a return as you battle enemy mechs from inside its cockpit in a first-person view.</desc>

		<desc>The people of Oedo Town are in a panic!  A gigantic UFO shaped like a peach has arrived, and the Peach Mountain Shoguns have turned Oedo Castle into one big stage for themselves to perform on!  Everyone's relying on Goemon to save the day, but he hasn't even noticed what's happening!  Can our hero stop the Shoguns before they do any more damage?

Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an action-based RPG similar in style to The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time.  It is also the first localized Goemon game since The Legend of the Mystical Ninja for the SNES.  Players control Goemon and his friends as they make their way through Ancient Japan to stop the Peach Mountain Shoguns.  You can talk to characters, whack enemies with your pipe (or hurl coins at them), visit a deranged fortune teller who shrieks out "PLASMA!" at random intervals for no reason, and more.

Each member of the Goemon team can also learn a special ability to access new areas as players progress through the game.  Goemon earns the "Sudden Impact" power, which lets him move blocks he normally couldn't, Ebisumaru can shrink to small sizes so he can pass through tiny cracks, Sasuke earns an extra high jump, and Yae gets the ability to transform into a Mermaid so that she can swim underwater.

As usual, the gigantic roller-skating robot, Impact, makes an appearance.  Players get to use him to trample down buildings and duke it out in first-person mode against gigantic mecha boss characters in a Punch-Out!! style game.</desc>

However, Skorne crushed Garm and imprisoned his soul in the Underworld. Skorne, fearing the power of the Runestones, scattered them throughout the four realms, so that they could never be used against him. The player(s) must defeat the end bosses of each of the four realms to obtain the four golden keys which allow access to Skorne's temple. While traveling through each realm, he/she/they must also collect the Thirteen Runestones from where they have been scattered. The complete set of Runestones allows him/her/them to pursue Skorne to the Underworld in order to finally destroy him. The players must find 3 rune stones on each kingdom in order to defeat Skorne in the Underworld, and of course 1 from the battle grounds.</desc>

Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.

Ten years later, a mysterious organization named "Janus" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called "GoldenEye", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.

In this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you'll have to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.</desc>

Virtual mode is the more familiar format of a battle game with game modes such as circuit, tournament and practice. It also has 2D and 3D "rules" for how the game is played. 2D is 16-bit arcade style and 3D is more realistic.</desc>

		<desc>Centre Court Tennis is a tennis game that does not take itself too seriously. After creating your Lego-like character, you are set to go! 

The basic game features a multiplayer mode (up to 4 players), a tournament mode and an exhibition mode. You also have four mini-games, "Tennis Court Bingo", "Burning Barrels", "Run and Gun" &amp; Knock'em Down", where your goal is to hit certain objects in the tennis field. You can win special prices for getting enough points.

Additionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd conditions - your tennis field might be rotating, made from ice or about to explode, to name a few. Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choosing from your opponent's dressing room. Lose and you lose an item that your opponent picked. Keep on losing and you have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of family-friendly strip tennis.</desc>

Unable to use the full fleet on the Emperor's defenses, which would cause mass casualties, they decide that a lone Lod Runner should enter the enemy base to recover any gold found and destroy the Emperor.

From an isometric style perspective, you must guide Lode Runner through each of the levels, dodging defensive blocks and enemies by either placing bombs and blowing holes in the ground to finding another way around. By finding all of the gold on the level, you can then progress to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. 

The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.</desc>

Players roll dice to move across themed boards, each filled with surprises and over fifty mini-games. Competitions range from free-for-all challenges to two-on-two and three-against-one battles, testing skills in racing, puzzles, and quick reflexes. Winning games earns coins and stars, determining the ultimate party champion.
Game boards feature animated elements, hazards, and special challenges. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, and Bowser all join the fun, each with their own board. While Mario Party offers solo play, the real fun comes with friends, ensuring an unforgettable multiplayer experience full of laughter, strategy, and late-night excitement.</desc>

In Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and coins.  At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions.

Duel mode allows play between just two people.  You still race around the board, but mini-games are only played when you land on a specific square.  Another play change is the addition of another character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game.

Story mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the computer.</desc>

		<name>Mickey no Racing Challenge USA (Japan)</name>
		<desc>The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar!  All that was left of him was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van.  Mickey rounds up all of his friends (and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States.  The Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor's top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of the tracks.  Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown.

Mickey's Speedway USA is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine.  Players compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races wins the gold trophy.  There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them.  Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights.

The game has an assortment of pickups - there's the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer, which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few.  There are also 'Oomph Tokens' scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer's maximum speed a little.

As well as the main game, Mickey's Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in Mario Kart 64 - players must pop their opponents' three balloons before they lose all of their own).  The game is also Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of Mickey's Speedway USA.</desc>

In Story Mode you take control of bio-mechanical mechas called Evas to fight against monstrous beings called Angels. To see every mission through, combo attacks (punches and kicks), blocking and grappling techniques are available at your disposal. Depending on the damage the Eva you control takes and if certain parameters are met during that time you will be given a time limit in which you must end the battle with the Angel. 

The Simulation Mode: almost plays like a shooter. It’s a 1st-person perspective mode where you must eliminate as many Angels as possible within the time limit. When the time limit ends you get a rank depending on how many enemies you destroyed and how many bullets you used.</desc>

Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D.

The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand (yeah, you read right!).

Playable characters include: Captain Falcon* (F-Zero), Donkey Kong, Fox (Star Fox), Kirby, Jigglypuff* (Pokémon), Link (Legend of Zelda), Luigi* (Mario), Mario, Ness* (Mother/EarthBound), Pikachu (Pokémon), Samus (Metroid) and Yoshi (Mario)

		<desc>Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world.  Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters...

Perfect Dark is a first person game similar to Rare's earlier Goldeneye: 007 though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms.  In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop.

The Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.</desc>

Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.</desc>

		<name>Snobo Kids (Japan)</name>
		<desc>A racing game where you control one of five cutesy snowboarders competing against each other. Being a snowboarding game, each track is a downhill slalom with a ski lift at the bottom which takes you back to the start for however many laps a track has.

The tracks are varied, the first few taking place on snowy mountainsides, while the latter taking you to wackier locales such as grassy countryside, a desert and a theme park. The money collected on the course or won at the end of the race can be spent to buy better boards, which differ in stats, or to collect items/weapons while racing. There are also stunts that can be performed while racing which earn money as well, and certain parts of each course encourage the player to do so.

Other modes include stunt mode, shoot mode and speed mode, all focusing on a particular part of the gameplay from the main game, and a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can race each other. There are also unlockables for dedicated players.</desc>

		<desc>Big Mountain 2000 is a sports game where you can choose to race with either a snowboard or a ski. There are six characters (plus three unlockables) to choose from, each with different skills and three modes in total – two of them are single player and the other one is a multiplayer.

1. Championship: in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want – ski or snowboard.  You can also change each player’s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options – Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you must finish first and before time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the later’s course being wider and the flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering, acceleration, etc. are increased.

2. 2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder.

3. Time Attack: there are no other competitors in this mode – just you racing against time.</desc>

		<desc>The cosmos is controlled by two Prime Elements, known as "Core" and "Dark". Each is possessed by a tyrant who is in perpetual search of the third element, the Light, which would grant its owner tremendous power. Sonork Nezom, the carrier of Core Element, has organized a fighting tournament, with Core Element itself being the prize. He hopes that the carrier of the Light Element will be among the participants. He plans then to strike and gain possession of all the elements at once. But Lord Demon Demitron, the carrier of the Dark Element, has other plans...

In this one-on-one fighting game, the player can take any of the eight playable participants through the tournament mode. Once the selected hero has defeated his opponents, he will have to face battles against Sonork and Demitron. A practice mode is also available. During the fights the player can use standard attacks common for all the characters - vertical and horizontal punches, kicks, running jumps, etc. Each character also possesses an arsenal of special techniques, which can be executed by pressing different buttons in rapid succession.</desc>

		<desc>Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police.  Their mission?  Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones.  They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.

Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits.  The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target.  There's also the Fish Food, which is used to...er, feed fish.  Really.

Even though they're called Drones, these bugs aren't stupid.  When encountered, they'll rush you, hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements when you confront them.  They also take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be rescuing.  But the Drones are nothing compared to the game's insanely difficult bosses, which includes a pair of gigantic praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few.

Each of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces.  These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach.  The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.

The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.</desc>

		<desc>The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the original Top Gear Rally.

Along with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important.
New sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.

Much like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges.

You can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.</desc>

As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play against a friend.</desc>

		<desc>In Chopper Attack, you take a chopper and.. well.. attack! You get to choose between eight different attack choppers, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. 

After the briefing from your XO, you are set to destroy something - tanks, other helicopters, planes, radars, buildings etc. While the mission only requires you to do something specific, destroying everything gives you bonuses and money, which you can then use to buy more heavy-duty missiles between the missions.

If you look at the screenshots, you might think that Chopper Attack is a helicopter simulation. It's not. Your elevation is fixed. There are no physics. You have boss fights with GIANT choppers. The game is pure 3D action, plain and simple.</desc>

The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature.

Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the "road to Wrestlemania" mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</desc>
